      <h1>Seoul Skincare Routine: The Ultimate 10-Step Korean Beauty Guide</h1>
      
      <p class="lead">The Seoul skincare routine has taken the world by storm, and for good reason. Korean women are famous for their flawless, luminous skin, and their secret lies in the meticulous <strong>Seoul skincare</strong> regimen that has been perfected over generations.</p>

      <h2>Why Seoul Skincare is Different</h2>
      <p>Seoul, the beating heart of K-beauty innovation, is where the most advanced skincare techniques and products are developed. The <strong>Seoul skincare routine</strong> isn't just about applying products—it's a philosophy that emphasizes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prevention over treatment</strong> - Protecting skin before damage occurs</li>
        <li><strong>Hydration as foundation</strong> - Multiple layers of moisture</li>
        <li><strong>Gentle, consistent care</strong> - Daily rituals over harsh treatments</li>
        <li><strong>Innovation meets tradition</strong> - Ancient ingredients with modern technology</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Complete 10-Step Seoul Skincare Routine</h2>
      
      <h3>Step 1: Oil-Based Cleanser (첫 번째 클렌징)</h3>
      <p>In Seoul's top skincare clinics, the double cleansing method always starts with an oil-based cleanser. This removes makeup, sunscreen, and sebum without stripping your skin.</p>
      <p><strong>Seoul favorite brands:</strong> Banila Co Clean It Zero, Heimish All Clean Balm</p>

      <h3>Step 2: Water-Based Cleanser (두 번째 클렌징)</h3>
      <p>The second cleanse uses a gentle, pH-balanced water-based cleanser to remove any remaining impurities and water-based debris.</p>
      <p><strong>Popular in Seoul:</strong> COSRX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser, Innisfree Green Tea Foam Cleanser</p>

      <h3>Step 3: Exfoliation (각질 제거) - 2-3 times per week</h3>
      <p>Seoul skincare experts recommend gentle exfoliation using chemical exfoliants (AHA/BHA) rather than harsh physical scrubs.</p>
      <p><strong>Seoul dermatologist picks:</strong> COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid, Neogen Bio-Peel Gauze Peeling</p>

      <h3>Step 4: Toner (토너/스킨)</h3>
      <p>Korean toners are nothing like Western astringents. Seoul skincare toners are hydrating essences that prep skin for better absorption of subsequent products.</p>
      <p><strong>Must-try from Seoul:</strong> Son & Park Beauty Water, Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner</p>

      <h3>Step 5: Essence (에센스)</h3>
      <p>This is where <strong>Seoul skincare</strong> truly differs. Essences are lightweight, concentrated formulas packed with active ingredients that target specific skin concerns.</p>
      <p><strong>Seoul's holy grail:</strong> COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence, Missha Time Revolution The First Treatment Essence</p>

      <h3>Step 6: Serum/Ampoule (세럼/앰플)</h3>
      <p>Highly concentrated treatments targeting specific concerns like brightening, anti-aging, or acne. This is customized based on your skin's needs.</p>
      <p><strong>Top sellers in Seoul:</strong> The Ordinary Niacinamide, Innisfree Green Tea Seed Serum</p>

      <h3>Step 7: Sheet Mask (시트 마스크) - 2-3 times per week</h3>
      <p>Seoul's convenience stores are lined with hundreds of sheet mask options. These provide an intensive burst of hydration and active ingredients.</p>
      <p><strong>Seoul favorites:</strong> Mediheal N.M.F Aquaring Ampoule Mask, Leaders Insolution AC-Dressing Skin Clinic Mask</p>

      <h3>Step 8: Eye Cream (아이 크림)</h3>
      <p>The delicate eye area requires special attention. Seoul skincare routines never skip this step.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended in Seoul:</strong> Innisfree Jeju Orchid Eye Cream, Sulwhasoo Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Eye Cream</p>

      <h3>Step 9: Moisturizer (모이스처라이저/크림)</h3>
      <p>Lock in all previous layers with a moisturizer suited to your skin type. Seoul offers options from gel creams to rich emulsions.</p>
      <p><strong>Seoul bestsellers:</strong> Etude House Moistfull Collagen Cream, Laneige Water Bank Moisture Cream</p>

      <h3>Step 10: Sun Protection (자외선 차단제) - AM Only</h3>
      <p>This is the MOST important step in any <strong>Seoul skincare routine</strong>. Korean women are religious about sunscreen application, rain or shine.</p>
      <p><strong>Seoul's top picks:</strong> COSRX Aloe Soothing Sun Cream, Innisfree Daily UV Defense Sunscreen</p>

      <h3>Spring Seoul Skincare</h3>

      <h3>Summer Seoul Skincare</h3>
      <p>Lightweight, gel-based products with high SPF. Misting throughout the day is essential.</p>

      <h3>Fall Seoul Skincare</h3>
      <p>Transition to richer moisturizers and add hydrating ampoules.</p>

      <h3>Winter Seoul Skincare</h3>
      <p>The driest season requires heavy creams, facial oils, and humidifiers running 24/7 in Seoul homes.</p>
