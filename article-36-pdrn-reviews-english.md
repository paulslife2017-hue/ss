## Negative PDRN Reviews (What Went Wrong?)

### Review #12: Jessica, 40, USA - Minimal Results
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐ 3/5  
**Sessions:** 3 sessions  
**Cost:** $1,500

**Her Story:**
*"I was excited about PDRN after reading amazing reviews, but my results were subtle at best. Skin feels slightly better, but not the dramatic change I expected."*

**What Went Wrong?**
- Only did 3 sessions (doctor recommended 5 for her concerns)
- Didn't follow post-treatment care properly
- Expected instant results (patience needed)

**Lesson Learned:** "I should have committed to the full treatment plan and been more patient."

---

### Review #13: David, 45, UK - Wrong Expectations
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐ 3/5  
**Sessions:** 4 sessions  
**Cost:** £1,400

**His Story:**
*"PDRN improved my skin texture, but I wanted wrinkle reduction. Doctor should have recommended Botox instead for my deep forehead lines."*

- Wrong treatment for his specific concern
- PDRN is for skin quality, not deep dynamic wrinkles

**Lesson Learned:** "Choose the right treatment for your specific concern. PDRN isn't magic for deep wrinkles."
