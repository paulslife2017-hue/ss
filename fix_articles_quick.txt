Quick Fix Plan:
1. Articles 1-5: Complete ✅
2. Articles 6-8: Placeholder (set published: false until integrated)
3. Articles 9-15: Complete ✅  
4. Articles 16-20: Missing (will add as published: false)

This way homepage will show only complete articles (1-5, 9-15 = 12 articles)
Users won't see incomplete content
