      <li>Visit the sauna to open pores and soften skin</li>
      <li>Remove all clothing (scrubs are done nude in gender-separated areas)</li>
      <li>Rinse off before heading to the scrub area</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>During the Scrub:</h3>

      <li>Lie on a waterproof mat on a raised platform</li>
      <li>The attendant will scrub your entire body systematically</li>
      <li>Expect to see rolls of dead skin coming off (this is normal!)</li>
      <li>The process can feel rough but shouldn't be painful</li>
      <li>You'll be asked to turn over multiple times</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>After the Scrub:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Optional milk or honey treatment for extra softness</li>
      <li>Light massage to help circulation</li>
      <li>Cucumber slices on face to cool and refresh</li>

    <h2>Korean Body Scrub Techniques Explained</h2>

    <h3>1. Traditional Italian Towel Scrub (이태리 타올)</h3>
    <p>The most common method using coarse green or pink exfoliating mitts called "Italy towels." These mitts are rough enough to remove dead skin but designed not to damage healthy skin.</p>

    <h3>2. Milk Scrub (우유 때밀이)</h3>
    <p>After traditional scrubbing, milk solution is applied and massaged into skin. Milk contains lactic acid which gently exfoliates while moisturizing. Leaves skin incredibly soft and bright.</p>

    <h3>3. Honey Scrub (꿀 때밀이)</h3>
    <p>Similar to milk scrub but uses honey-based solution. Honey is antibacterial and deeply moisturizing. Great for dry or sensitive skin.</p>

    <h3>4. Red Clay Scrub (황토 때밀이)</h3>
    <p>Uses Korean red clay (hwangtoh) which is rich in minerals. Detoxifying properties help draw out impurities while nourishing skin.</p>

    <h3>5. Salt Scrub (소금 때밀이)</h3>
    <p>Coarse sea salt is used for extra exfoliation and mineralization. Particularly popular for body areas with rough skin.</p>
