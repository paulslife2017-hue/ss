## What is PDRN Treatment? The Science Behind Salmon DNA Therapy

### Understanding PDRN (Polydeoxyribonucleotide)

**PDRN treatment** is an injectable anti-aging therapy that uses DNA fragments extracted from salmon sperm cells. Yes, you read that right – salmon DNA! But here's why it's revolutionary:

**Key Benefits of PDRN Treatment:**
- ✅ **Stimulates collagen production** naturally
- ✅ **Accelerates skin cell regeneration** up to 300%
- ✅ **Reduces fine lines and wrinkles** within 2-3 weeks
- ✅ **Improves skin elasticity** and firmness
- ✅ **Heals acne scars** and pigmentation
- ✅ **Minimizes pore size** dramatically
- ✅ **No downtime** required

### Why Salmon DNA? The Korean Beauty Secret

Korean dermatologists discovered that salmon DNA is 95% compatible with human DNA, making it incredibly effective for skin regeneration. The **PDRN molecule** acts as a powerful healing agent that:

1. **Activates A2A receptors** in skin cells
2. **Promotes angiogenesis** (new blood vessel formation)
3. **Enhances oxygen and nutrient delivery**
4. **Reduces inflammation** and oxidative stress
5. **Accelerates wound healing** at cellular level

### PDRN vs. Other Anti-Aging Treatments

| Treatment | Cost per Session | Downtime | Results Timeline | Longevity |
|-----------|------------------|----------|------------------|-----------|
| **PDRN Therapy** | $150-$500 | None | 2-3 weeks | 6-12 months |
| Botox | $300-$800 | None | 3-7 days | 3-4 months |
| Dermal Fillers | $500-$1,200 | 1-2 days | Immediate | 6-18 months |
| Microneedling | $200-$400 | 2-3 days | 4-6 weeks | 3-6 months |
| Laser Resurfacing | $800-$2,000 | 7-14 days | 8-12 weeks | 12+ months |

**Winner:** PDRN offers the best balance of cost, safety, and natural-looking results!

## PDRN Treatment FAQs: Everything You Need to Know

### Q: Is PDRN treatment painful?
**A:** With proper numbing cream, most patients report only mild discomfort. Pain level: 2-3/10. Much less painful than traditional microneedling.

### Q: How long do PDRN results last?
**A:** Initial results last 6-12 months. With regular maintenance (every 3-6 months), effects can be sustained long-term as your skin continues producing collagen.

### Q: Can I combine PDRN with other treatments?
**A:** Yes! Popular combinations:
- PDRN + Botox (done separately)
- PDRN + Microneedling
- PDRN + LED therapy
- PDRN + Vitamin C infusion

### Q: When is the best time to get PDRN treatment?
**A:** Fall and winter are ideal (September-March) due to less sun exposure. However, treatment is safe year-round with proper sunscreen use.

### Q: How many sessions do I need?
**A:** Minimum 3 sessions for optimal results. Severe concerns may require 5-8 sessions. Your dermatologist will recommend based on skin assessment.

### Q: Can I wear makeup after PDRN?
**A:** Wait 24 hours before applying makeup. Use only non-comedogenic, mineral-based makeup for the first week.

### Q: Is PDRN suitable for sensitive skin?
**A:** Yes! PDRN is actually excellent for sensitive skin as it reduces inflammation and strengthens the skin barrier.

### Q: What's the difference between Rejuran and PDRN?
**A:** Rejuran is a brand name of high-quality PDRN product from Italy. All Rejuran is PDRN, but not all PDRN is Rejuran. Rejuran typically costs 20-30% more.

### Q: Can men get PDRN treatment?
**A:** Absolutely! Male patients love PDRN for skin texture improvement and anti-aging without looking "done."

### Q: Are results immediate?
